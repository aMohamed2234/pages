               <h4>HISTORY</h4>
               <p>Perth University was started in 1961 as an Advanced-level Sixth Form College offering Science and Arts subjects by a group of professionals, who formed a charitable Educational Trust (now the Perth Educational Trust). Perth university was the first in Pre-independence Kenya to accommodate all races, religions, and social standing. Saint Josemaría Escrivá, the founder of Opus Dei, inspired and encouraged them to start the university.<br>
                <br>
                In March 1966, the first intake of Accountancy students, twenty-five in number, joined the Sixth Form students and began preparing for the examinations of the UK-based Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA). These first Accountancy students were sponsored by Shell East Africa, BAT (East Africa), and the East African Breweries.<br>
                <br>
                 At this time Perth University was unique as a fully integrated post-Form 4 institution offering both academic and professional courses.
                
                In October 1982, owing to the increased demand from companies for the professional training of their employees, the university began evening courses in Accountancy after normal working hours, with 60 students sponsored by various companies.</p>
                <h4>ENROLMENT</h4>
                <P>A total population of 4,393 students(full-time and part-time) studying Accountancy, Administration, Commerce, Finance, Management, and Information Technology.</P>
                <h4>PERTH UNIVERSITY GAZETTED</h4>
                <p>
                    The Universitys Charter was gazetted under the Universities Act (CAP 210B) in the Kenya Gazette supplement no. 47 (legislative supplement no. 27) via legal notice no. 86. The charter details the establishment and functions of the University, membership, and governance of the University, administration, financial provision, and statutes of the University.
